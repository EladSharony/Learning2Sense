# Non-contact Topographic Sensing Under a Nonlinear Potential Field using Vibration Analysis with Machine Learning
#### Elad Sharony under the supervision of Dr. Yoav Vered and Prof. Izhak Bucher

## Followed are the first and second harmonics extracted from measurements based on the steady-state frequency response of an oscillating single degree of freedom system subjected to a nonlinear magnetic forcing due to two magnets.
